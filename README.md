# To Preject or to Reject: Causal Effect Estimation with Uncertainty on Networked Data

This is a repo hosting the source code for GraphDKL for causal effect estimation on graph data.
The full code will be uploaded with clear structure and testing instruction after the ICDM conference in Shanghai, 1-4 Dec 2023. Sorry I'm busy with my new project atm :).

DM me to my uni email if you urgently need it for testing and citation purpose before the ICDM conference, I'll send you the rough code for testing (a bit messy hhhh but works).

#UPDATE 27th Feb 2024
Hey guys, I'm updating this repo, due to my heavy workload from current paper deadline, I am expected to finish updating the repo by this weekend.
